 #### UDP FLOOD

◾️ A UDP flood is a form of volumetric Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where the attacker targets and overwhelms random ports on the host with IP packets containing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. In this type of attack, the host looks for applications associated with these datagrams ◾️

 #### ICMP (PING) FLOOD
{% include elements/figure.html image="https://github.com/ajaydevelopr/Blog-Pictures/blob/main/blog_pics/ping.png?raw=true" caption="ICMP Flood" %} 

◾️ Ping flood, also known as ICMP flood, is a common Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker takes down a victim's computer by overwhelming it with ICMP echo requests, also known as pings ◾️

 #### SYN FLOOD

◾️ A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic ◾️

 #### Ping Of Death

◾️ A ping of death is a type of attack on a computer system that involves sending a malformed or otherwise malicious ping to a computer. A correctly-formed ping packet is typically 56 bytes in size, or 64 bytes when the Internet Protocol header is considered. However, any IPv4 packet may be as large as 65,535 bytes ◾️

 #### Slow Loris

◾️ Slowloris is a type of denial of service attack tool invented by Robert "RSnake" Hansen which allows a single machine to take down another machine's web server with minimal bandwidth and side effects on unrelated services and ports ◾️

 #### NTP Amplification
{% include elements/figure.html image="https://github.com/ajaydevelopr/Blog-Pictures/blob/main/blog_pics/NTP.png?raw=true" caption="NTP" %}

◾️ NTP amplification is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in which the attacker exploits publically-accessible Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to overwhelm the targeted with User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic. ... The NTP server responds by sending the list to the spoofed IP address ◾️

 #### HTTP Flood
{% include elements/figure.html image="https://github.com/ajaydevelopr/Blog-Pictures/blob/main/blog_pics/Httpflood.png?raw=true" caption="Http Flood" %}

◾️ HTTP Flood is a type of Distributed Denial of Service attack in which the attacker manipulates HTTP and POST unwanted requests in order to attack a web server or application. These attacks often use interconnected computers that have been taken over with the aid of malware such as Trojan Horses ◾️
