# **About Me**

---

Hi, I'm **Ajay ☾**.

I'm an Electronics Engineer graduated from Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra In 2020.<br>
As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python • PHP • Java • HTML • CSS • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy • TensorFlow • Keras • Matlab • R **_and more!_**

Which I use for:

Machine learning • Data Science • Data Vizualization • Graph Analytics • Computer Vision • Web Development **_and more!_**

Thankfully, I'm not a cat!

When I'm not working on something ML or data science, you can find me working on building various projects based on PHP! I also love **playing** football, _watching_ Formula 1 and singing and I'm always up for a game of Mario Kart :)
